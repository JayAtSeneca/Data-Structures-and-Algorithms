There are many different data structures that can be used to perform tasks similar to those of a Trie, such as search, begins_with, and insert. Some examples include hash tables and binary search trees.

Hash tables are a data structure that allows for efficient insertion, deletion, and searching of data. They work by using a hash function to map data to a specific location in a table, allowing for constant-time access to the data. In terms of the tasks that a Trie can do, a hash table would be particularly good at the insert and search tasks. Insertion into a hash table is generally very fast, as it simply involves computing the hash value of the data and then adding it to the table at the corresponding location. Searching in a hash table is also generally fast, as it involves computing the hash value of the data and then looking it up in the table at the corresponding location.However, a hash table would not be as effective at the begins_with task that a Trie can do. This is because a hash table does not have the built-in ability to search for prefixes. It can only search for exact matches to the keys that have been inserted into the table.

Binary search trees, on the other hand, are a data structure that allows for efficient search and insertion of data. They work by storing data in a tree-like structure, where each node in the tree represents a piece of data and has links to other nodes. In terms of the tasks that a Trie can do, a binary search tree would be particularly good at the search and insert tasks. Searching in a binary search tree is generally very fast, as it involves traversing the tree to find the desired data. Insertion into a binary search tree is also generally fast, as it involves finding the correct location in the tree to add the new data. However, like a hash table, a binary search tree may also not be as efficient for search and prefix searching tasks because it requires traversing the tree to access data, which can take more time and effort than simply looking up data in a Trie.
