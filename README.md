# DSA456-Works

Welcome to my data structures and algorithms repository! This collection of code serves as a reference for the various data structures and algorithms that I studied in college.

The repository is organized by data structure, with each subdirectory containing implementation examples in various programming languages. The data structures covered include common ones such as linked lists, stacks, queues, and trees, as well as more advanced ones such as graphs and hash tables.

In addition to the data structures, the repository also includes examples of common algorithms for searching, sorting, and traversing data. These include linear and binary search, quicksort and mergesort, and depth-first and breadth-first traversal.

I hope that this repository serves as a useful reference for anyone looking to refresh their knowledge of data structures and algorithms or to learn more about these important computer science concepts.
