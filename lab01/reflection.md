## What did you like/not like about Python
ANSWER:  Python is a simple and easy to learn language. In python, I like when we start writing the code there is no need to write the boilerplate code and we can just simply start writing the code. Another thing I like about python is like as compare to lot of other programming languages we don't need braces and semicolon in the program. These are the reasons why I like python language.

## Was there anything that behaved differently than you expected in Python?
Two things. Firstly, Indentation and space error. Secondly, the keyword self inside the python objects

## Based on what you wrote in your lab, write something about the similarities and differences between Python with C/C++ and how that affects how you write your program.
**Similarities:**
1. The lazy evaluation
2. defining the variables before using it(scoped variables)
3. constructor and __init__ function in python objects
4. self keyword is similar as "this" keyword in c++

**Differences:**
1. Syntax difference
2. Inheritance in classes in python
3. Declaring a variable in python is different
