## What did you like/not like about Python
ANSWER:  Python is a simple and easy to learn language. In python, I like when we start writing the code there is no need to write the boilerplate code and we can just simply start writing the code. Another thing I like about python is like as compare to lot of other programming languages we don't need braces and semicolon in the program. These are the reasons why I like python language.

## Was there anything that behaved differently than you expected in Python?
Two things I experienced which behaved differently than expected in python. Firstly, I got spaces and tabs error, the error message was pointing at the error but not giving proper error message for indentation error. Secondly, the keyword "self" inside the python objects, I got few errors in python for not using the "self" keyword as the first member function argument which is different in python then other programming languages. 

## Based on what you wrote in your lab, write something about the similarities and differences between Python with C/C++ and how that affects how you write your program.
**Similarities:**
1. The lazy evaluation to check the multiple condition is same in python like other programming language.
2. Like C/C++, defining the variables before using it is similar in python. Also, the rules for the scope of variable is similar.
3. The Object Oriented Programming(OOP) in python is same as C/C++

**Differences:**
1. Like C/C++ in python the Inheritance in classes is bit different because we are not describing the mode of base class. For example, Inheriting the base class in public, private or protected mode 
3. In Python, declaring a variable in python is different because like C/C++ we don't have to describe the variable type like int, float, double, string and char etc.
